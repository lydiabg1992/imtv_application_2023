## Your life in a music video
### This colorful application is a single-page web app developed using React and Spotify's Web API. Users can enter search criteria such as artist name, song name, album title or keywords, and a list will populate from Spotify's database. Users can add songs to (or remove songs from) a personalized playlist, which they can then upload back to their own Spotify account to save and listen to later.
